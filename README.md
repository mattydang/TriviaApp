# Trivia App
Trivia App written with React.js library. App allows user to answer a list of generated questions, and display score at the end.

## Technologies Used:

### React.js

The quiz displays one question at a time from the data array. Each question has four options, and the user selects one as the answer.

React was used for the useState() hook, where state variables could be made and changed from original data. Used React hooks like useState() and useRef() to manage the quiz state and dynamically update the UI. For example, tracking the current question index, lock state, score, and whether the quiz has ended and updating the styling for correct and wrong answers.

The app also validate the answer in real time for user by changing the styling of buttons to red or green for wrong/right answer, and locking the state so users cannot change their answers. 

The app also displays the user's score at the end of the quiz. Offers a "Reset" button to restart the quiz. Upon resetting, the quiz, score, and states reverts to their initial values, allowing the user to play again.

### HTML

Used to connect fonts from Google fonts to application and set title.

### CSS

CSS styling was used to apply design to UI, with display of background, buttons, and changes to buttons upon a mouse event.
